Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature selection, normalization)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern identification

Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

Deep Learning models (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers)

AI-based predictive analytics for stock market trends

Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared scores

Visualization of stock trends and model predictions

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Yahoo Finance API

Model Training & Prediction

Load the dataset and preprocess it.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train various ML models and compare their performances.

Implement an LSTM model for sequential stock price prediction.

Use AI techniques for advanced pattern recognition and trend analysis.

Evaluate and visualize predictions.

Results & Performance

The performance of the models is measured using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared Score

AI-driven models improve predictive accuracy over traditional ML approaches.

LSTM models tend to perform better for sequential time series predictions.

Future Enhancements

Integration of real-time stock market data

Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance

Use of reinforcement learning for improved predictions

Implementation of AI-based sentiment analysis on financial news
